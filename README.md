# HealthBotApp
PLEASE NOT THAT THE GITPAGES IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! Fully functional verison coming soon. 

This is my Health Bot App mock up, this was a ton of fun! I designed many different designs within a week. 

To-do for this app




1.) connect bootstrap properly to work with git pages (DONE)





2.) make index.html something more, maybe add a 3d model version of some of the robos as I go through Blender :) 





3.) See if some voice lines can be done, maybe little animations instead of the mock up to show it off more as a full idea



4.) Once gitpages is corrected please use a link so people can see the project via a portfoloio


:)
